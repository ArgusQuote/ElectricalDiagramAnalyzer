# Security Practices

## Secrets Management
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code
- Never log sensitive data (credentials, PII, session tokens)
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager for all credentials
- Add secret-containing files to .gitignore before they are created

## Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all external input at system boundaries
- Use parameterized queries for database operations -- never string concatenation
- Escape output appropriately for the target context (HTML, SQL, shell)

## Dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained dependencies with active security response
- Review new dependencies before adding them -- check for known vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies updated to receive security patches

## Authentication and Authorization
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Verify authentication and authorization on every protected operation
- Never rely solely on client-side validation for security decisions
