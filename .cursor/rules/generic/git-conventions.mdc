# Git Conventions

## Branches
- Use descriptive branch names with a type prefix: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `docs/`, `test/`
- Keep branch names lowercase with hyphens as separators
- Delete branches after merging

## Commit Messages
- Write a concise summary line (50 chars or less) in imperative mood
- Add a body explaining WHY the change was made, not WHAT changed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Do not commit unrelated changes together -- one logical change per commit

## Pull Requests
- Write a clear title summarizing the change
- Include a description with context, motivation, and test plan
- Keep PRs focused -- prefer small, reviewable changesets over large batches
- Ensure all checks pass before requesting review

## Never Commit
- Secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens
- Environment files (.env) containing real values
- Generated files that can be reproduced from source
- Large binary files without explicit approval
