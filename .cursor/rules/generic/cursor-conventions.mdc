# Cursor Rules Organization

Rules in `.cursor/rules/` are organized into three categories:

## domain/
Technology-specific rules for the frameworks and tools used in this project. Consult when working with framework-specific code patterns.

## generic/
Universal rules that apply regardless of technology. Includes coding standards, git conventions, security practices, and this meta rule.

## project/
Project-specific rules and living documentation:
- **project/docs/api-patterns.mdc** -- External API integrations and connection patterns
- **project/docs/architecture.mdc** -- System architecture and pipeline flows
- **project/docs/data-structures.mdc** -- Data models, DTOs, and schema conventions
- **project/docs/file-locations.mdc** -- Source code map and module boundaries

Consult the appropriate docs/ rule when you need context about how this project works.

## Skills

Reusable skills live in `.cursor/skills/`. Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file following the Agent Skills open standard. The agent discovers skills by their metadata and loads them on demand.

The `generic/skill-routing.mdc` rule maps task types to skills. When a task matches a routing entry, load the corresponding skill for its procedure.
