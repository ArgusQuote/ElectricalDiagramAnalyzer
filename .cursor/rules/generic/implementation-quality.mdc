# Implementation Quality

After implementing any code change, always verify correctness before presenting results:

1. Run the project's tests on changed files -- all must pass
2. Run the linter on changed files -- no new errors
3. Run the type checker if applicable -- no new errors
4. If any check fails, fix the root cause and re-verify
5. Do not present code to the user until all checks pass or you have documented why a check cannot run

When implementing a feature or fix, follow the plan-implement-verify loop:
- Plan the approach before writing code
- Implement in small, verifiable increments
- Verify after each increment
- If verification fails 3 times on the same issue, stop and present findings to the user

Load the `implementing-changes` skill for the full workflow procedure.
