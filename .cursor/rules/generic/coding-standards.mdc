# Coding Standards

## Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood (e.g., URL, HTTP, ID)
- Be consistent with naming patterns across the codebase

## Error Handling
- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Always log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Use specific exception types, not generic Exception

## Code Quality
- No magic numbers or strings -- use named constants
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting

## Documentation
- Document WHY, not WHAT (code shows what, comments explain why)
- Keep comments up to date when changing code
- Add a brief doc comment to public methods explaining purpose and parameters
