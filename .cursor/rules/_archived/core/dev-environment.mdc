# Development Environment Setup

This rule ensures the correct Python environment is activated before running any Python code.

## Virtual Environment Activation

**ALWAYS run this command before executing any Python code:**

```bash
source /home/marco/venv/bin/activate
```

## When This Applies

| Action | Requires Activation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Running Python scripts | ✅ Yes |
| Running pytest/tests | ✅ Yes |
| Installing pip packages | ✅ Yes |
| Running the uplink server | ✅ Yes |
| Running DevEnv scripts | ✅ Yes |

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source /home/marco/venv/bin/activate

# Verify activation (should show venv path)
which python
# Expected: /home/marco/venv/bin/python

# Deactivate when done (optional)
deactivate
```

## Important Notes

- The virtual environment contains all project dependencies (EasyOCR, OpenCV, PyMuPDF, etc.)
- Running Python without activation will result in missing module errors
- Always activate before any `python` or `pip` commands
